# Skematik
_Easy task sheduling for events_

### What's this?
Skematik is a tool to have participants take action in a certain event or thing, where you need them divided in groups. These can be shifts, games, positions, whatever you like. 

### How do I set this up?

copy the config.template file to images/api/src/helpers/config.js

If you're familiar with Docker (and we suggest you do, cause everything else might be some setup), it's as easy as following these steps:
1) Run `npm install`, `bower install` & `gulp prod` in /public to make sure you have the right front-end files
2) Run `docker-compose up --build` in root-folder
3) ..
4) Profit!
