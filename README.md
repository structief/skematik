# Skematik
_Easy task sheduling for events_

### What's this?
Skematik is a tool to have participants take action in a certain event or thing, where you need them divided in groups. These can be shifts, games, positions, whatever you like. 

### How do I set this up?

0) Copy the config.template file to images/api/src/helpers/config.js, and add a passphrase that suits you best

If you're familiar with Docker (and we suggest you do, cause everything else might be some setup), it's as easy as following these steps:
1) Run `npm install`, `bower install` & `gulp prod` in /public to make sure you have the right front-end files
2) Run `docker-compose up --build` in root-folder
3) ..
4) Profit!

### What if something goes wrong?
We're happy to assist, submit an issue or pull-request, and we'll get back to you!
